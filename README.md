# Simplified Execution Engine

SEE bids farewell to the dark ages of downloading and unzipping datasets. Instead of bringing the large amounts of data to the execution environment, SEE brings your code into the cloud where the data already exists. This will grant faster data access, scalability with computation on the data, and providing features most wouldnâ€™t dare to implement to run their code.

SEE is also designed to take a users code base, perform linting, security analysis, and offer change suggestions related to pythons best practices. Plug and play modules for scanning and other things.

## Features
   - Automatic code linting and formatting.
   - Execution environment detection.
   - Library use detection.
   - Codebase security audits.
   - Determining python version automatically.
   - Optimization.
   - Determining how computationally intelligent the user is.
   - File/database caching optimizations, speed hacks.
   - Recomendations for improvements to code bases.

# Project Management
In this section we will provide progress reports on the project through iterations discussing interations, logic and analysis for different parts of the system.

## Iteration 1
The first iteration requires UI, Data Access, and Business Logic interactions and logic.

### UI
Some of the main UI interfaces that will be included in our project
- Plug and play module
    - input code to be linted 

### Data Access


### Business Logic
- filtering and linting 

### Things Done
* Created Repo and established CI tools
* Researched client side frameworks
* Researched server side frameworks
* Created simple blueprints for proposed System
* List of core filters we want included
  * source code length warnings
  * lint warnings (ex: inconsistent styles)
  * inconsistent code language verions (ex: python 2.7 vs 3.x)
  * common sql mistakes
* Reasearched some existing web app solutions
  * pep8online (https://github.com/Bryukh/pep8online)

### Stuff To Do
* Research python tools
* React dir tree
* React in browser code editor
* study gitlab CI/CD for python

### More Ideas
* Boolean question flowchart tree
  * no requirements.txt or similar -> "Does your project use any dependencies?" If yes, recommend a req.txt...
  * Look for license file -> "Is your project licensed? There's no apparent license file" Then recommends a basic template for the license file
  * Another example: "Looks like you don't have a readme, you should make one and tell people about your project"

### This is the RACI chart for the group.

## Iteration 2

### Risk Analysis
* Data retention policies not established - not part of our project
* Cannot guarantee perfect code sanitization which can be a risk to our system since it will remotely run their code - very difficult to be able to perfectly link and filter for every single error

### More ideas 
* Should mention somewhere in application that we are no liable for any damages caused by the program that is linted through out system
