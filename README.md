# Simplified Execution Engine

Our system is designed to take a users code base, perform linting, security analysis, and offer change suggestions related to pythons best practices.
Plug and play modules for scanning and other thins.

## Features
   - Automatic code linting and formatting.
   - Execution environment detection.
   - Library use detection.
   - Codebase security audits.
   - Determining python version automatically.
   - Optimization.
   - Determining what level of stupid they are.
   - File/database caching optimizations, speed hacks.
   - Recomendations for improvements to code bases.
